## Business Overview
MedX Pharma is a top pharmaceutical sales and distribution company with operations spanning several U.S. states. 
It collaborates with healthcare distributors, hospitals, and retail pharmacies to ensure the prompt delivery of premium-quality medications. 
The company oversees a diverse portfolio of pharmaceutical products, manages multiple warehouses, and partners with sales representatives and third-party distributors to broaden its market presence and meet growing demand.

## Problem Statement
The company is experiencing growing operational complexity due to an expanding product portfolio, a larger customer base, and increased sales activities across multiple regions. 
However, its reliance on flat Excel files for storing critical sales, customer, and distribution data has created challenges in performance monitoring and insight generation. 
The absence of a centralized data system and reporting solution prevents management from accurately identifying top-performing products, sales representatives, and regions, thereby limiting their ability to make timely, data-driven business decisions. 

## Project Aim
- This project aims to transform MedX Pharmâ€™s flat file data into a normalized and structured data model using Power BI
- Build an interactive dashboard to analyze product sales, customer behavior and sales trend
- Enable data-driven decision-making and improve visibility into sales and distribution operations.

## Methodology
I cleaned the dataset on Excel and imported into Power BI. I developed a data model with the dataset, creating fact and dimension tables with an additional date dimension table. 
Established connections via primary and foreign keys.
Created additional columns and calculated measures with DAX functions. Finally, designed interactive reporting dashboards to support strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.
